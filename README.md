# Hero Helper

This is a practice application to learn Angular.

It is inspired by the Tour of Heroes angular tutorial.

If you would like to use Postman to test the backend API calls there is a config file, named HeroHelper.postman_dump.json, that you can load into Postman that has all of the calls set up for you.
