# Hero Helper

This is a practice application to learn Angular.

It is inspired by the Tour of Heroes angular tutorial.

To run the client use

    npm start

Make sure you also have the server running

    npm run start:server

The client will be served at http://localhost:3000 \
The server will be served at http://localhost:3001

If you would like to use Postman to test the backend API calls there is a config file, named HeroHelper.postman_dump.json, that you can load into Postman that has all of the calls set up for you.
