# Hero Helper

This is a practice application to learn Angular.

It is inspired by Angular's Tour of Heroes tutorial.

    npm start

To run the server:

If you would like to use Postman to test the back-end API calls there is a config file, named HeroHelper.postman_dump.json, that you can load into Postman that has all of the calls set up for you.
